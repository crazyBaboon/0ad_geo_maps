# 0ad_maps

A collection of geographically accurate maps for 0ad. 

The biomes should match the real climate zones to 
an approximate extent.

The wildlife should also match the existent one.

## South East Asia

  This is a tropical naval map consisting of mainland Vietnam, Laos, Malaisia, Camboja together with Indonisia.
  All players start in large jungle islands with only wood as a primitive resource.
  To get metal and stone, the players need to go out in the sea and find these resources elsewhere.
  But beware of the beasts scattered all over these rich areas...
